## Installation

```
sanity install netlify-deploy-status-badge
```

or

```bash
npm install --save sanity-plugin-netlify-deploy-status-badge

```

or

```bash
yarn add sanity-plugin-netlify-deploy-status-badge
```

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured through `sanity.config.ts`:

```ts
import { netlifyDeployStatusBadge } from "sanity-plugin-netlify-deploy-status-badge";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    netlifyDeployStatusBadge({
      apiId: "YOUR_NETLIFY_API_OR_SITE_ID",
    }),
  ],
});
```

or with authentication via OAuth.

```ts
import { netlifyDeployStatusBadge } from "sanity-plugin-netlify-deploy-status-badge";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    netlifyDeployStatusBadge({
      apiId: "YOUR_NETLIFY_API_OR_SITE_ID",
      auth: {
        oauthClientId: "YOUR_NETLIFY_OAUTH_APP_CLIENT_ID",
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Authentication

By default, accessing deploy logs via the API does not require authentication. However, if you set your site's deploy logs to private, the plugin need to be setup with OAuth for you to authenticate in order to pull in data. Being authenticated also enables you to trigger a new build on your site.

Authentication can be done in two ways: OAuth or personal tokens. Support for the latter will be implemented later as I'll need to spend more time integrating it with [sanity-studio-secrets](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-studio-secrets).

#### Which one to choose?

With personal tokens, anyone who has access to your Sanity Studio can do administrative actions on your behalf such as trigger a new build, etc. while with OAuth, anyone who has access to your Sanity Studio will still need to login and authorize with their Netlify account to do the former actions mentioned.

#### How to configure?

To configure OAuth, go to your [User Settings > Applications > OAuth](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications). Click `New OAuth application`. Fill out the following:

1. Application Name - `Sanity Plugin Netlify Deploy Status Badge` or any name you prefer.
2. Redirect URI - `<YOUR_SANITY_STUDIO_URL>/netlify-deploy-status-badge` (eg: https://dorelljames.sanity.studio/netlify-deploy-status-badge)
3. Click **Save** and copy generated **Client ID**.
4. Open `sanity.config.ts` or (.js) and add the following like this below:

```js
netlifyDeployStatusBadge({
  apiId: "537d0d4d-3443-4cf7-b838-fe0478131e18",
  auth: {
    oauthClientId: "<COPIED_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>",
  },
});
```

5. Voila! Done.
